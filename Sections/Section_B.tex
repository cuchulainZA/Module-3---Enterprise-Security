    Despite security risks, 75\% of CEOs use applications that aren't approved by IT [1]
    
Managing technology in an organisation can be a challenge at the best of times. This problem increases
as an organisation grows, and along with the what is often referred to as 'shadow IT'. One are in particular
is the integration and adoption of new technologies by the higher echelons in an organisation. Typically
this is done without formal approval or integration with organisational IT, with the inherent authority
being used to justify this. This was seen clearly with the mass adoption of the various Apple computing
devices. This is despite Apple ( unlike the Blackberry platform) not having any kind of enterprise
integration. Your task is to address how this can be managed in an organisation, and in particular what
the resultant risks could be and how they could in turn be mitigated. You should state any assumptions,
and provide suitable context to the case study you are using. Expected length 6-8 pages. (30)
