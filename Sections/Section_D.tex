Molina Health [1] is the latest in a long string of breaches in the healthcare sector [2,3,4]. Statistics
previously released, claim that one in three Americans' healthcare records were leaked as a result of
hacking and IT-related breaches in 2015 [5]. While the healthcare sector is not alone in this it often
strikes closer to home with consumers than other PII leakage.

Describe and discuss how the effective use of IT Audit could be used in the reduction of the risk of a
potential breach in an organisation. You should choose a suitable case study to illustrate your discussion.
You should consider some of the particular challenges in the healthcare sector.
Expected length 6-8 pages. (30)
