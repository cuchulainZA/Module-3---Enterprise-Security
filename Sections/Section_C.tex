Using the Intel Threat Agent Library ( available on the course page) map out a threat actors and
landscape for TWO of the following scenarios:
    • Ransomware
    • Industrial Espionage
    • Loss of PII via data breach
This should be done for an organisation of your choice and you should provide suitable motivation for
your decisions. You should state any assumptions, and provide suitable context to the case study you
are using.

Expected length 4-6 pages and spreadsheets. (15x2=30)
